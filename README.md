<h2>Research Question</h2>


Are counties with a higher concentration of super-spreader businesses associated with increased risk of COVID-19 transmission?
 
### Aim 1: Classify businesses into super-spreaders and not super-spreaders based on frequency and duration of visits pre-pandemic.

### Aim 2: Identify association between counties with higher super-spreaders and COVID-19 cases.

## Datasets
* [John Hopkins University Dataset for COVID 19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) - (For Confirmed cases and Deaths) 
* [SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium) - (To get Foot Traffic in businesses across industries)
* [NAICS](https://www.naics.com/search/) - (to map business codes to businesses and industries)


## Methodology 

* Aim 1: Classify businesses into super-spreaders and not super-spreaders based on frequency and duration of visits pre-pandemic.
    
* Aim 2: Identify association between counties with higher density of super-spreaders and COVID-19 cases.
