<h2>Research Question</h2>
 

Are counties with a higher concentration of super-spreader businesses associated with increased risk of COVID-19 transmission?
 
### Aim 1: Classify businesses into super-spreaders and not super-spreaders based on frequency and duration of visits pre-pandemic.

### Aim 2: Identify association between counties with higher super-spreaders and COVID-19 cases.

## Datasets

* [NAICS](https://www.naics.com/search/) - (to map business codes to businesses and industries)


## Methodology 

* Aim 1: Classify businesses into super-spreaders and not super-spreaders based on frequency and duration of visits pre-pandemic.
    
* Aim 2: Identify association between counties with higher density of super-spreaders and COVID-19 cases.
